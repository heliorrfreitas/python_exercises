# Feet to Meters and Vice Versa

This code uses Tkinter to create a simple calculator that converts feet to meter and meter to feet. 

Initially I started playing around and followed a tutorial that led me to create the calculator for converting feet to meter. 

Then, to learn the concepts and apply what I learned. I create the opposite conversion - meters to feet. So to summarize, I created new buttons, input box, display to show the result, and labels. Also, I converted the formula using my math skills, and finally created the new function in python.

## Running the tests

To run the application I used the code below:

`python3 main.py`

Then, I checked if the fields were in the places I wanted first. 

Then I checked if the calculation was right and if the result being displayed matched with my expectations.
