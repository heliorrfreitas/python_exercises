# Python exercises
These are the python exercises from exercism.io that I worked on. 

I am studying and working on the exercises from a web site called Exercism.io. This repository is a collection of exercises I worked on from the python track.

Python track: https://exercism.io/tracks/python

### Testing
The web site gives a test script for each problem. To run the tests you run the program like you would run a simple python file in a terminal. Just type ```python test.py``` and it should give you some feedback.
