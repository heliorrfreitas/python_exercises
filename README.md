# Python exercises
These are the python exercises from exercism.io that I worked on. 

I am studying and working on the exercises from a web site called Exercism.io. This repository is a collection of exercises I worked on from the python track.

Python track: https://exercism.io/tracks/python

### Testing
The web site gives a test script for each problem. To run the tests you will need to install ```pytest``` if you do not have it installed.Then type ```python3 -m pytest test_script.py``` and it should give you some feedback. I am using python 3 to do the exercises.
